<h1>Building data pipelines</h1> 

<h3>Week 7 - Monday project - Data pipelines with python</h3>
<br>Steps:
<br>1- Data was extracted from csv files shared by customer
<br>2- Data transformation was done. E.g: imputing missing promo values, data type conversion
<br>3- Aggregation was done to explore data characteristics. E.g: calculation of mean values
<br>4- Cleaned data was exported to csv file on local disk for further analysis

<h3>Week 7 - Tuesday project - Data pipelines with python and postgreSQL</h3>
<br>Steps:
<br>1- Data was extracted from csv files shared by customer
<br>2- Data transformation was done. E.g: dropping duplicate date columns, data type conversion
<br>3- Aggregation was done to explore data characteristics. E.g: calculation mean sensor reading
<br>4- Cleaned data was uploaded to postgreSQL database hosted on google cloud

<h3>Week 7 - Wednesday project - Data pipeline with python and mongodb </h3>
<br>Steps:
<br>1- Data was extracted from csv files shared by customer
<br>2- Data transformation and enrichment was done. E.g: data type conversion, adding duration_minutes column
<br>3- Data loading functions were implemented - without compression | with compression | aggregation
<br>4- Data was loaded to mongodb collections hosted on mongodb.com
